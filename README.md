============

Solve the problem of random walk.

##Question

[English](https://gist.github.com/4159080)

[Japanese](https://gist.github.com/3671661)


##Policy

Does not solve the problem efficiently.
I will challenge in solving the problem to think "Walker".

###Why it does it this way?

Because I thought I could write an interesting program with Akka, if "Walker".
And I wanted to write a program to move autonomously.

###Benefit


###drawbacks


##Design
I have created an algorithm in Akka.

## Requirements
* Simple Build Tool Ver.0.12.0

## Run

    sbt run

##Next Step
* visible map -- Finished!
* more walkers -- Finished!
* parallel -- Finished!
* walker is better strategy to learn
